                <h1>About us</h1>
        
                <p>Hey everyone, I’m Myles! I’m pretty new to the off-road world, but once I got a taste of dirt trails and big tires, I was hooked. The thing is, being new means I had about a million questions—What gear should I run? How do I fix this weird rattle? Which trail won’t leave me stranded overnight?</p>
                
                <p>Instead of bugging my buddies 24/7, I figured, why not create a place where all of us—rookies and veterans alike—can swap stories, share advice, and just hang out? That’s how Trail Chatters came to life.</p>
                
                <p>I may not have the most tricked-out rig (yet), but I’m here to learn, laugh, and maybe get stuck a few times along the way. If you’re into off-roading, wrenching, or just shooting the breeze about your build, you’re in the right spot.</p>
